## koch.py
This is the Koch Snowflake being drawn.

`py koch.py`

## spiro.py
Draw various spirographs using simple calculation. Default will draw 4 random spirographs and once fully drawn it will start a new set over and over again. But you can pass parameters in to generate a specific design.

Default: `py spiro.py`

Passing parameters examples:

`py spiro.py -- 300 100 0.9`

`py spiro.py -- 300 200 0.6`

`py spiro.py -- 300 200 0.2`

## conway.py
Conway's game of life is a cellular automation game that has a set of rule on how the cells will expand/grow.

`py conway.py`

See Conway_Figure_1.png as example of saving the game down at a particular time which was close to the end where only block (2x4 square), loaf (surrounded/circular like), blinker (1x3 line), or glider (almost points in a direction) is left.
